# Current position


<button>Managing Director</button> 
<button class="secondary">Xebia Data</button> 
<button class="contrast">2022.01--Now</button> 

At Xebia Data, I am responsible for our consulting, academy, and solutions business.

# Experience

<button>Chief Science Officer</button> 
<button class="secondary">GoDataDriven</button> 
<button class="contrast">2016.07--Now</button> 

As GoDataDriven Chief Science Officer, I had a number of responsibilities.
Among them:

- Help clients become data driven enterprises; this includes helping them
  shaping their data architectures, hire and foster data scientists and data
  engineers, and, last but not least, help them set them up experiments
  platforms;
- Help and lead our team of data scientists through the crucial steps of their
  projects;
- Ensure that the many trainings GoDataDriven prepares are consistent in their
  high quality, methodology, and format, so that the students can enjoy practice
  driven trainings that immediately help them apply the knowledge learned.

As we're far from being a corporation ourselves, I still very much enjoy
designing the shoes that you get when you join the company.

<button>Data Whisperer</button> 
<button class="secondary">GoDataDriven</button>
<button class="contrast">2013.10--2016.06</button> 

At GoDataDriven I enjoy what probably is the coolest job title I'll ever have:
**Data Whisperer**. As for my daily tasks, they involve advising clients on how
to extract valuable insights from (big) data analysis. Being a swell chap, once
that is done, we perform these analysis and build data driven products with a
stellar [team](http://www.godatadriven.com/team.html).

I am also a certified Cloudera trainer for the Data Analyst, Developer,
Admin, and Spark Cloudera courses.


<button>IT Consultant</button> 
<button class="secondary">KPMG</button> 
<button class="contrast">2012.10--2013.09</button> 

At KPMG I was mainly doing source code analysis and code quality reviews.
Occasionally involved in the Big Data group and overall always happy to help
when some advanced modeling or analytics are needed.

<button>PhD, Th. Physics</button> 
<button class="secondary">Leiden University</button> 
<button class="contrast">2008.07--2012.09</button> 

I focused on models describing DNA mechanics, taught Statistical Physics and
Stochastic processes to Master students and had a lot of fun.

While doing that I programmed, wrote papers and delivered stunning
presentations. You don't believe me? I think we should talk.

<button>Research Assistant</button> 
<button class="secondary">Leiden University</button> 
<button class="contrast">2007.08--2008.07</button> 

It was a fake job. In the pre-crisis years, Leiden University thought to have a
lot of money, so it was paying me to work on my Master thesis. Crazy, right?


# Education

<button>MSc Th. Physics</button> 
<button class="secondary">Leiden University</button> 
<button class="contrast">2006--2008</button> 

Exams average: 8.5/10. Total: 8.25/10 (It's lower than the exams, I KNOW!)

<button>BSc Phsyics</button> 
<button class="secondary">Universit√† degli studi di Padova</button> 
<button class="contrast">2003--2006</button> 

Getting my Physics bachelor in Padua means I became *Doctor* (in Italy I became a doctor with a Bachelor. Now you know why they're in recession).

Exam average: 100/110. Total: 105/110.


# Languages

That'd be a long list, but long story short I am very good in English and
Dutch, and less so in Spanish and French. Annoyingly good in Italian.




# Interests

I have a passion for photography and my favorite subjects are my wife and my seven kids.

Furthermore, I like reading, writing, playing the guitar and music in general.
