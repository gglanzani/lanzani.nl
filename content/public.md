### Techsummit Europe

I was invited to participate in a panel at the [Techsummit] Europe 2024. Once and if the recording comes online, I'll post it here.

## NoSQL Matters

Back in 2014, I spoke in Dublin and Barcelona about how I used pandas instead of a database for a fairly large web app. There are no recordings available, but [proof] of my PowerPoint skills is still around.


## Masterclasses

I gave a couple of masterclasses. One of them, given at the University of Amsterdam, has been posted online.
