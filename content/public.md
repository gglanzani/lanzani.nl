In this page I report some of the public appearances through the years.



# Conferences

## PyData

PyData is the conference closest to my heart, having started the Amsterdam meetup and organized and chaired the first PyData Amsterdam conference. I've talked at various instances of the conference numerous times, and often at meetups.

## Techsummit Europe

I was invited to participate in a panel at the [Techsummit] Europe 2024. Once and if the recording comes online, I'll post it here.

## NoSQL Matters

Back in 2014, I spoke in Dublin and Barcelona about how I used pandas instead of a database for a fairly large web app. There are no recordings available, but [proof] of my PowerPoint skills is still around.
